  <p class="lead">
  I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. In 2021, I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of Washington, advised by Fang Han and Daniela Witten. I was then a Kruskal instructor in Statistics at University of Chicago from 2021 to 2023, and a postdoctoral researcher hosted by Zhou Fan at the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Yale University. 

    I am broadly interested in nonparametric and semiparametric statistics, high dimensional inference, and applied probability.
