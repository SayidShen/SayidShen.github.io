  <p class="lead">
  I am a fifth-year PhD student in the <a href = "http://www.stat.washington.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> 
    at the University of Washington, advised by 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/">Daniela Witten</a> and 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/adwillis/">Fang Han</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>
Outside of research, I prioritize statistics education and initiatives related to equity.
My teaching objectives emphasize undergraduate statistics education and teaching statistical literacy and best practices to non-statisticians.
Inside and outside of my teaching, I actively try to leverage my position to advocate for and work towards building more equitable communities and cultures within statistics, as well as STEM and academia more broadly, at all levels.
<br/>
<br/>
Before coming to UW, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Zhejiang University, China.
